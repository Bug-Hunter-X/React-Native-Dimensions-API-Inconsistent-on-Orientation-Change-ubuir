This bug occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The issue arises when the app is run on a device with a different screen orientation (portrait or landscape) than the one used during development. The dimensions returned by `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` may not reflect the current orientation, leading to layout issues.
